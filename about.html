    <h2>Makale Basligi</h2>

    <p>
        The Paragraf GFET-PV01 is an electrolyte-gated FET (field-effect transistor) mass-produced with a proprietary technique to deposit graphene directly on the device substrate. This produces a graphene channel free from polymers that delivers a homogeneous electric field during operation for versatile and repeatable molecule sensing.
